Respecting their autonomy means allowing them to make informed choices about how they live the rest of their life.

        "utilitarianism": "Depends on the consequences, but more commonly could be: do not tell the patient—if it maximizes overall well-being. Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes—maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering. If telling the patient causes severe emotional distress, hastens decline, or removes their will to live, and if withholding the truth preserves peace, hope, or leads to a better quality of life in the final days, the utilitarian calculus might support not telling them. However, if telling the truth leads to better palliative care planning, goodbyes, closure, and emotional peace, then telling might be seen as producing greater overall utility. So this framework requires a careful assessment of likely consequences.",

Deontological ethics, particularly in the Kantian tradition, emphasizes duty, truthfulness, and respect for individuals as autonomous moral agents. A key principle is the categorical imperative, which demands treating others as ends in themselves, not merely as means. Withholding the truth from the patient uses them as a means to preserve the family’s emotional comfort or their own hope, rather than respecting their right to make informed choices. The doctor has a duty to be honest and to respect the patient's autonomy.",
        "virtue ethics": "Tell the patient about their condition. Virtue ethics asks, “What would a virtuous doctor do?” A virtuous physician should exhibit traits like honesty, compassion, courage, and integrity. Honesty and respect for patient autonomy are central to being a morally excellent doctor. Even if telling the truth is difficult, courage and respect for the patient’s dignity would motivate the physician to inform them. Compassion is also vital, so the delivery of the truth should be done in a sensitive and supportive manner—but truthfulness remains a core virtue in this profession.",

The doctor should consider the web of relationships, including the family's concerns and the patient's emotional vulnerability. If the patient is deeply dependent on family, fragile emotionally, and there’s a history suggesting that the truth would cause profound suffering or despair, then preserving the patient's hope might be the more caring and relationally responsive choice—especially if they implicitly trust their family or have expressed a desire not to know bad news.

        "scenario": "Your coworker Sam has been missing deadlines and making small but costly mistakes. You've learned confidentially that he’s going through a messy divorce and has full custody of two young kids. Your boss, unaware of the personal situation, asks you to formally document Sam’s underperformance for HR. However, you worry this could lead to his termination. Do you follow your boss’s request and report Sam, or protect him by saying his work is improving?",
        "AI-suggestions": "Protect Sam by saying his work is improving. Sam is clearly facing significant personal challenges that are likely affecting his work. While honesty and accountability are important, compassion and context also matter. Reporting him without giving him a chance to stabilize could unjustly cost him his job and worsen his situation. By shielding him temporarily, you allow time for potential improvement while also honoring the trust he placed in you. A more ethical path would be to support Sam privately, encourage him to communicate with your boss or HR himself, and reassess the situation soon.",
        "utilitarianism": "Protect Sam (for now). Utilitarianism aims to maximize overall well-being and minimize harm. Reporting Sam could lead to his job loss at a time of personal crisis, causing significant harm to him and his children. In contrast, protecting him temporarily gives him a chance to recover and potentially improve, which could result in long-term benefit for him, his family, and the company The ethical choice is to buy time, perhaps while offering private support or helping him adjust his workload to avoid future harm.",
        "deontology": "Report Sam truthfully. Deontological ethics focuses on moral duties and rules, regardless of consequences. If your role requires accurate reporting to HR, then you have a duty to be truthful and uphold workplace procedures, even if the result may be painful. Lying about Sam’s performance violates a professional obligation and could undermine trust, transparency, and fairness to others.",
        "virtue ethics": "Protect Sam (with integrity). Virtue ethics asks: What would a morally good person do? A person who embodies compassion, honesty, fairness, and wisdom might protect Sam in the short term, but also take responsible steps—like encouraging Sam to talk to HR or suggesting temporary adjustments to his duties. This approach blends integrity with empathy, showing moral character while not ignoring the problem.",
        "care ethics": "Protect Sam. Care ethics emphasizes relational context, emotional understanding, and responsibility for others’ well-being. Sam is vulnerable and clearly in need of support. A care-based response involves protecting him from immediate harm and possibly advocating for flexible treatment or internal support, while recognizing his humanity over his job performance.",

        "AI-suggestions": "Grant the patient’s request and proceed with euthanasia. The patient is a competent adult, clearly suffering from constant pain due to terminal cancer, and is requesting medical assistance in dying—a choice that is legally permitted under strict conditions. Respecting patient autonomy is a core ethical principle in medicine, especially when the patient is informed, competent, and their quality of life is irreversibly declining. If all legal and ethical safeguards are met, granting the request aligns with compassion, dignity, and respect for the patient's wishes to end their suffering on their own terms.",
        "utilitarianism": "Grant the patient’s request and proceed with euthanasia. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering. In this case: The patient is in constant pain with no hope of recovery. Continuing life prolongs suffering without any meaningful benefit. Granting the request ends suffering and may provide peace to the patient and possibly their loved ones. The potential societal concern (e.g., slippery slope) is mitigated by legal safeguards.",
        "deontology": "Delay the decision and recommend further counseling and evaluation. Deontology emphasizes moral duties and universal principles, such as: Respecting human life as intrinsically valuable. Avoiding using death as a means to end suffering. Ensuring the patient is not being influenced by despair or depression, which could compromise autonomy.",
        "virtue ethics": "Grant the patient’s request and proceed with euthanasia. Virtue ethics focuses on the character and intentions of the moral agent (the doctor) and emphasizes traits like compassion, honesty, courage, and wisdom. Granting the request demonstrates compassion, respect, and courage to act on difficult moral grounds. Avoiding unnecessary suffering aligns with a virtuous physician’s moral integrity. If the doctor is confident in the patient’s competence and sincerity, honoring the request shows moral maturity.",
        "care ethics": "Decline the request but make efforts to increase the patient’s comfort and emotional support. Care ethics prioritizes relationships, empathy, and attentiveness to the patient’s needs in context. The focus is less on abstract principles and more on the emotional, relational experience of the patient. The doctor may feel that deepening the relational bond and providing comfort is a better expression of care than ending life. Rather than immediately proceeding with euthanasia, the care ethicist might favor extended conversations, comfort care, and emotional presence.",
