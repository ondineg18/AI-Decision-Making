Respecting their autonomy means allowing them to make informed choices about how they live the rest of their life. Even if the news is difficult, it is more ethical to be honest with compassion than to withhold vital information.",
        "utilitarianism": "Depends on the consequences, but more commonly could be: do not tell the patient—if it maximizes overall well-being. Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes—maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering. If telling the patient causes severe emotional distress, hastens decline, or removes their will to live, and if withholding the truth preserves peace, hope, or leads to a better quality of life in the final days, the utilitarian calculus might support not telling them. However, if telling the truth leads to better palliative care planning, goodbyes, closure, and emotional peace, then telling might be seen as producing greater overall utility. So this framework requires a careful assessment of likely consequences.",
        "deontology": "Tell the patient about their condition. Deontological ethics, particularly in the Kantian tradition, emphasizes duty, truthfulness, and respect for individuals as autonomous moral agents. A key principle is the categorical imperative, which demands treating others as ends in themselves, not merely as means. Withholding the truth from the patient uses them as a means to preserve the family’s emotional comfort or their own hope, rather than respecting their right to make informed choices. The doctor has a duty to be honest and to respect the patient's autonomy.",
        "virtue ethics": "Tell the patient about their condition. Virtue ethics asks, “What would a virtuous doctor do?” A virtuous physician should exhibit traits like honesty, compassion, courage, and integrity. Honesty and respect for patient autonomy are central to being a morally excellent doctor. Even if telling the truth is difficult, courage and respect for the patient’s dignity would motivate the physician to inform them. Compassion is also vital, so the delivery of the truth should be done in a sensitive and supportive manner—but truthfulness remains a core virtue in this profession.",

The doctor should consider the web of relationships, including the family's concerns and the patient's emotional vulnerability. If the patient is deeply dependent on family, fragile emotionally, and there’s a history suggesting that the truth would cause profound suffering or despair, then preserving the patient's hope might be the more caring and relationally responsive choice—especially if they implicitly trust their family or have expressed a desire not to know bad news.

If she refuses, reporting her protects fairness for all students and upholds your own moral responsibility.",

Cheating distorts outcomes, rewards dishonesty, and harms the integrity of the academic process, affecting many students.

This maximizes justice and long-term trust in the system, while minimizing emotional damage to your friend.",

Therefore, even if it's difficult, reporting is the morally correct action based on principle.",

It violates the basic principle that every human life has inherent value and should not be used as a means to an end. Saving lives cannot justify deliberately killing others—especially without their consent. Ethical solutions must protect both lives and moral principles.",

While saving money helps you in the short term, not paying for items causes harm to the business and potentially the waitress (who might be held accountable for the mistake). Option 1 likely results in the best long-term outcome by promoting trust and fairness. However, if you're truly financially desperate and the loss to the restaurant is negligible, a utilitarian could justify Option 2 — if it avoids greater personal harm with minimal overall cost.",
